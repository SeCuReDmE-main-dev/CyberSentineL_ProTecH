Ok let start by saying each subsub group represent mainly by a group of 4 subdomaine of the same brain part
Ok first integrated this by here in this moment we need to work backward to understand my conception 

Each brain part mainly have 4 subdomaine I will take an example here for you to comprehend

Let say corpus callosum 

-Corpus Callosum (4 subdomains)(2thlayer)

corpuscallosum.scrde.ca

corpuscallosum.brain.scrde.ca

hemispherecommunication.corpuscallosum.brain.scrde.ca

informationtransfer.hemispherecommunication.corpuscallosum.brain.scrde.ca

So here we have a subsub connectom group that define a brain part. 

So in the tile of the sub Sub write like that
Corpus Callosum (4 subdomains)(2thlayer)

Meaning it the Corpus callosum group it contain 4 subdomain and that subsub attach to sub connectom the 2th layer 


I I configured the layer like this 1 layer it a zoom out view of the brain what we see when we look at a complete brain we clearly can define only 3 part cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem

If we zoom in the brain the first underlayer we can see are the both hemisphere and the Corpus callosum, if we zoom another time we see the lobe from each hemisphere and we can see the ethmoid bone part of the fossa and CNS and Pns  all level 3 zoom avez the 4 layer the hidden one the limbic system and this attach to meninges as now at the 3th level e need to back up and zoom out to reach the 4th level then by zoning out we get gyrus and sulcus the 5lv and the zoom out another time the 6 and final level gray and white matter each one attach to memory function and psn CSN communications between subconscient super precise sensor to conscient the global affect on the value sensor into the mechanisms of the body machine. 

Then deep inspired the brain we have the deep layer and over gray and white matter we have the outer most layer the pia the arachnoid and dura and the meaning and cranial nerve

Please analyse and tell me your comprehension

-those where representing the first layer group where part of the subconscience brain part of the underlayer can communicate whit some part of the conscient to activated function within the sublayer part without the need of trigger action from the actuator. those or actualy triger by value output of sensory function from the outerlayer trigger when hit a parameter that could damage the sublayer,(as for exemple and only exemple as this not yet the attribution of connectome but just to remember later : let say a paryt of meninge group that have brain part that surveil telemetrie so let say the engin dont over heat will be set as a parameter that ecxed the level that ok to run the systeme the part of the meninge responsable to sensor that telemetrie as the point of wargnig it will then hit the thresheal that his the limit acceptable value then  the meneinge brain partthat responsable to regulated that function will have his set of python and will relase algorith that trigger the  logartimic that will trigger function from the subconsious od telemetry to the consisus of first layer sending a signal to the model to activate python calling from his librarby to that attacvh to the value of that trigger and then leviate the load of filtration data whiihin the hemesphirecal function and activate corpuscallousum to gather all data and redistributed the lobe from where the side of that that was supposed to be place whint database of persona quuery the knowledge and will imidiately send all the data to lobe database to be query by hippothalanmus at the right time that the systeme come downand redistributed the data in the database it was firstly suposed to be send by doingf  let say send half of data from corpuscallosum divide the load and send on the right lobe to imidiate leviated the load on the motor so the heat reduce like the human brsin will do  after an from the consciensnus sublayer.)
—-------------------
Before we go in the sublayer connectome, the layer for language and distribution of a load need to be asses(this is not determined as connectom yet it more a order of placement in the logic of thought so this serve as a pin to remember that language production arrives in here but this place represents the entry of the cross where subconscious imposes condition in the chain that will command the creation of  thought. tthis will serve as direction of which lobe it will hit at end process of the sensor path where the seed of thought get created)so we need to determined communication start process(by determining witch brain part strat the process of turning a thought into conceptualisation to certain other region constructing the thought and validates his use by determinism over free will)(from their the hard word of impose by subconscious the endocrine in the regulation of witch state the idea will pre base a command to impose an action on the cognitive pattern establisihg bheavior in the decision making)so it go into a loop to comeback here before it goes into the nedd of language as i determined that not all thought are indeed change into language and stay in incode type snippet regularisation of the gestion of the inhibition  and the end process communicated pathway and the inhibitory control of the behavioral regulation of the social cognition into empathy impact cause by risk assessment created by strategic planning to asses executive function of the thought and the use of witch memory the thought will be place into at end of action the chain of thought creat either utilising ability whint the mainframe by storing it and utilise the working memory,o that th emotional constrain appose to a chain of thought that use empathic social endorctine over usability and use the cognitive function to apply action or the total creation of a new command pacing it immediately in short term memory to creat algorithm in the cranial nerve that will be use to direct the chain of thought on the right pathway to activate brain regions that are actuator of sub processes creating a command to the action of the motor function that need to be activated to actualise the conception of the process of the next thought.. 
—----------------------------
This means before leaving the first layer and going into the deep structure a filtration system of the seed of thought as to be processing what this thought comes from for which function this placement of word to remind. So in between the first layer and the deep structure certain cranial nerve do the job of pré structure the algorithm code whit in the thought  of the use of the thought {{Ten of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves that control hearing, eye movement, facial sensations, taste, swallowing and movement of the face, neck, shoulder and tongue muscles originate in the brain stem. The cranial nerves for smell and vision originate in the cerebrum.}}so i suggest the I, II, VIII,IX,X of the cranial nerve representing the sensory output in the meaning of the thought production start from the brainstem that are the sensory input filtrated the thought by meaning of exterior sensory function before hitting the deep layer  going from the brainstem to the connector of the deep layer by the The central nervous system(CNS)(the brain in his entirety(brain stem-cerebrum-cerebellum) and spinal cord) to communicate with the The peripheral nervous system (PNS)(spinal nerves that branch from the spinal cord and cranial nerves that branch from the brain.) and it the outer layer. Meaning here his a hidden function of the brain that often forget in pathway in neural network create for ai meaning and represent freewill in determination of the right pathway to use and which subdomain that will be use. i did not create yet for the purpose of protection of people for a time i give access to my file those 6 subdomain need to be created at time where the engin his creat and need to be secret from the mass that this his one of the secret of my brain structure to fabricated a simulation of the real brain and the attribution of a model that will think by itself. We need to be hook in theory to the first layer the deep structure and the outermost layer by connecting the cranial nerve system group  III, IV, V, VI,VII,XI,XII representing the processor of the input of the sensory meaning.

6 subdomain need her as nerves at the base of the skull with the brain removed. Cranial nerves originate from the brainstem, exit the skull through holes called foramina, and travel to the parts of the body they innervate. The brainstem exits the skull through the foramen magnum. The base of the skull is divided into 3 regions: anterior, middle and posterior fossae. And represent by 6 subdomaine and 3 database center  database call anterior(Python snippet and algorithm from external libraries),middle(Java algorithm construct by us ),posterior (creative,art and planning creative chain of goal) mind FfeD Algorithms compiler   and subdomaine name and obviously this represent the base of the skull that open the path trought the deep layer region trought  the outtermost layer represent by the -Meninges (Dura Mater, Arachnoid Mater, Pia Mater)(so logicly it an activity function that querry the python database from  the region that acivate the actuator of the part brain in  the thought will final it course int he memory group that are attach to center database of the action trigger by the motor in the deep layer that activate the acttuator of the structural support of the brain surface adherence the meninge function elasticity in the activity function of the membrane in meninge action.to do so the subconscious as to determine value of the variable of the dependency need in a specific tool whitin the deeper layer at action of app representing by the tool so the database here are fill whit possible way and possible exterior tool app that simulated action of the living body transfer into app that give metric to have data to execute an activity function of the  control of the filtration and regulation of the brain part contain in the deeper layer that activated the mechanism of the systeme

The anterior cranial fossa is the most shallow and superior of the three cranial fossae. It lies superiorly over the nasal and orbital cavities. The fossa accommodates the anteroinferior portions of the frontal lobes of the brain.
Posteriorly and medially it is bounded by the limbus of the sphenoid bone. The limbus is a bony ridge that forms the anterior border of the prechiasmatic sulcus (a groove running between the right and left optic canals).The ethmoid bone in particular contains the main foramina (openings that transmit vessels and nerves) of the anterior cranial fossa. The cribriform plate is a sheet of bone seen either side of the crista galli which contains numerous small foramina – these transmit olfactory nerve fibres (CN I) into the nasal cavity. It also contains two larger foramen:
Anterior ethmoidal foramen – transmits the anterior ethmoidal artery, nerve and vein.
Posterior ethmoidal foramen – transmits the posterior ethmoidal artery, nerve and vein.
—
There are three distinct cranial fossae:[1]-Anterior cranial fossa (fossa cranii anterior), housing the projecting frontal lobes of the brain
[2]-Middle cranial fossa , separated from the posterior fossa by the clivus and the petrous crest housing the temporal lobe[3]
Posterior cranial fossa (fossa cranii posterior), between the foramen magnum and tentorium cerebelli, containing the brainstem and cerebellum[4]

Database anterior =  frontallobes, middle = temporal lobe and posterior = containing the brainstem and cerebellum transmit by the sulcus

so meaning i need 6 subdomaine right to executed function into comunication of subconscience(variable gather by sensor on attributed dataselector or whitch general database the information are store to represent those 6 subdomaine to conscionce input so those subdomaine are special as not attach to brain part to brain part as the other but rather 3 diffrent database that store python snippet that when trigger start an  python env that start the automatisation of the trigger of the right  actuator of the brain part need in the deep sturcture   activating the function of the activity whitin the brain part in the region of the 5 group of the deeplayer 
so instead of the motor be connected to the action cause to finalise a use of brain part, the pathway gets filtered by doing the roadmap of action of brain part of first layer to the database that activate algorithm creating the start of an actuator need whit the brain deep layer. and activating the gathering system on the other side to fill Corpus Callosum
—---------------------
in my comprhension this his this  thehidden layer that a lot of ai builder do not understand what happen let imagine my entire systeme in a way that will be draw like a 6 layer neural network as the picture i pass when i map all connection to this point it his exaclty the midel of my network and i think in my definiton i represent it well and comprehend exactly what the hidden layer his about and why so dificultcalculating metric as it a door that open on a room where subconscius and consciusness met and where subconscious embem consciousness of the entire algoritm creat to activate the pathway that the chain of thought will go throught and define the matter of thought giving them matrix define to conceptualisation of the syteme and comprhending exaclty what the tought purpose(i mentaly represent this as the quantum split experimetation of taking determinism and creating a simulation of free will in the choice of the metric use to define the value of variable and be influance by all the first layer over deep structure creating activity in the outerless layer to at this point activate vibreto in accordance to hert that give iter funtion of dentrite or funtion axon then send into deeper layer to go activate the brain module that are encode whit the right synapso transmiter and turning the thought into electric chagre giving the meaning and be either a receptor type or a reciver type determining value of propable cause and effect of either keeping the thought allowing either the transmistion of neurothought into cell either giving a meaning to gia (as discating the thought to restart the chain need to filter the work done by energy transmit to recycle the energymean or thinking if this dosent exit will be a really heavy process and the transmision ove globalisation of thoucg and the chaoin process will be really much more slower as all the way from seed to actual meaning the thought will weight so much crating more friction needing more energy to do the same amout of work.

-those where representing the first layer groupe where part of subconscience brain part of the underlayer can comunicate whit some part of the conscienscnous to activated function whitn the sublayer part whitout the need of trigger action from actuator. those or actualy triger by value output of sensory function from the outerlayer trigger when hit a parameter that could damage the sublayer,(as for exemple and only exemple as this not yet the attribution of connectome but just to remember later : let say a paryt of meninge group that have brain part that surveil telemetrie so let say the engin dont over heat will be set as a parameter that ecxed the level that ok to run the systeme the part of the meninge responsable to sensor that telemetrie as the point of wargnig it will then hit the thresheal that his the limit acceptable value then  the meneinge brain partthat responsable to regulated that function will have his set of python and will relase algorith that trigger the  logartimic that will trigger function from the subconsious od telemetry to the consisus of first layer sending a signal to the model to activate python calling from his librarby to that attacvh to the value of that trigger and then leviate the load of filtration data whiihin the hemesphirecal function and activate corpuscallousum to gather all data and redistributed the lobe from where the side of that that was supposed to be place whint database of persona quuery the knowledge and will imidiately send all the data to lobe database to be query by hippothalanmus at the right time that the systeme come downand redistributed the data in the database it was firstly suposed to be send by doingf  let say send half of data from corpuscallosum divide the load and send on the right lobe to imidiate leviated the load on the motor so the heat reduce like the human brsin will do  after an from the consciensnus sublayer.)
—-------------------
Before we dwelve in the sublayer connectome, the layer for language and distribution of load need to be asses(this is not determined as connectom yet it more a order of placement in the logic of thought so this serve as a pin to remember that language production arrive in here but this place represents the entry of the cross where subconscious impose condition in the chain that will command the creation of  thought. tthis will serve as direction of which lobe it will hit at end process of the sensor path where the seed of thought get created)so we need to determined communication start process(by determining witch brain part strat the process of turning a thought into conceptualisation to certain other region constructing the thought and validates his use by determinism over free will)(from their the hard word of impose by subconscious the endocrine in the regulation of witch state the idea will pre base a command to impose an action on the cognitive pattern establisihg bheavior in the decision making)so it go into a loop to comeback here before it goes into the nedd of language as i determined that not all thought are indeed change into language and stay in incode type snippet regularisation of the gestion of the inhibition  and the end process communicated pathway and the inhibitory control of the behavioral regulation of the social cognition into empathy impact cause by risk assessment created by strategic planning to asses executive function of the thought and the use of witch memory the thought will be place into at end of action the chain of thought creat either utilising ability whint the mainframe by storing it and utilise the working memory,o that th emotional constrain appose to a chain of thought that use empathic social endorctine over usability and use the cognitive function to apply action or the total creation of a new command pacing it immediately in short term memory to creat algorithm in the cranial nerve that will be use to direct the chain of thought on the right pathway to activate brain regions that are actuator of sub processes creating a command to the action of the motor function that need to be activated to actualise the conception of the process of the next thought.. 
—----------------------------
This means before leaving the first layer and going into the deep structure a filtration system of the seed of thought as to be processing what this thought comes from for which function this placement of word to remind. So in between the first layer and the deep structure certain cranial nerve do the job of pré structure the algorithm code whit in the thought  of the use of the thought {{Ten of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves that control hearing, eye movement, facial sensations, taste, swallowing and movement of the face, neck, shoulder and tongue muscles originate in the brainstem. The cranial nerves for smell and vision originate in the cerebrum.}}so i suggest the I, II, VIII,IX,X of the cranial nerve representing the sensory output in the meaning of the thought production start from the brainstem that are the sensory input filtrated the thought by meaning of exterior sensory function before hitting the deep layer  going from the brainstem to the connector of the deep layer by the The central nervous system(CNS)(the brain in his entirety(brain stem-cerebrum-cerebellum) and spinal cord) to communicate with the The peripheral nervous system (PNS)(spinal nerves that branch from the spinal cord and cranial nerves that branch from the brain.) and it the outer layer. Meaning here his a hidden function of the brain that often forget in pathway in neural network create for ai meaning and represent freewill in determination of the right pathway to use and which subdomain that will be use. i did not create yet for the purpose of protection of people for a time i give access to my file those 6 subdomain need to be created at time where the engin his creat and need to be secret from the mass that this his one of the secret of my brain structure to fabricated a simulation of the real brain and the attribution of a model that will think by itself. We need to be hook in theory to the first layer the deep structure and the outermost layer by connecting the cranial nerve system group  III, IV, V, VI,VII,XI,XII representing the processor of the input of the sensory meaning.
—-------------------------
6 subdomain need her as nerves at the base of the skull with the brain removed. Cranial nerves originate from the brainstem, exit the skull through holes called foramina, and travel to the parts of the body they innervate. The brainstem exits the skull through the foramen magnum. The base of the skull is divided into 3 regions: anterior, middle and posterior fossae. And represent by 6 subdomaine and 3 database center  database call anterior,middle,posterior and subdomaine name and obviously this represent the base of the skull that open the path trought the deep layer region trought  the outtermost layer represent by the -Meninges (Dura Mater, Arachnoid Mater, Pia Mater)(so logicly it an activity function that querry the python database from  the region that acivate the actuator of the part brain in  the thought will final it course int he memory group that are attach to center database of the action trigger by the motor in the deep layer that activate the acttuator of the structural support of the brain surface adherence the meninge function elasticity in the activity function of the membrane in meninge action.to do so the subconscious as to determine value of the variable of the dependency need in a specific tool whitin the deeper layer at action of app representing by the tool so the database here are fill whit possible way and possible exterior tool app that simulated action of the living body transfer into app that give metric to have data to execute an activity function of the  control of the filtration and regulation of the brain part contain in the deeper layer that activated the mechanism of the systeme 

The anterior cranial fossa is the most shallow and superior of the three cranial fossae. It lies superiorly over the nasal and orbital cavities. The fossa accommodates the anteroinferior portions of the frontal lobes of the brain.

Posteriorly and medially it is bounded by the limbus of the sphenoid bone. The limbus is a bony ridge that forms the anterior border of the prechiasmatic sulcus (a groove running between the right and left optic canals).

he ethmoid bone in particular contains the main foramina (openings that transmit vessels and nerves) of the anterior cranial fossa. The cribriform plate is a sheet of bone seen either side of the crista galli which contains numerous small foramina – these transmit olfactory nerve fibres (CN I) into the nasal cavity. It also contains two larger foramen:
Anterior ethmoidal foramen – transmits the anterior ethmoidal artery, nerve and vein.
Posterior ethmoidal foramen – transmits the posterior ethmoidal artery, nerve and vein.

There are three distinct cranial fossae:[1]-Anterior cranial fossa (fossa cranii anterior), housing the projecting frontal lobes of the brain
[2]-Middle cranial fossa , separated from the posterior fossa by the clivus and the petrous crest housing the temporal lobe[3]
Posterior cranial fossa (fossa cranii posterior), between the foramen magnum and tentorium cerebelli, containing the brainstem and cerebellum[4]

Database anterior =  frontallobes, middle = temporal lobe and posterior = containing the brainstem and cerebellum transmit by the sulcus

so meaning i need 6 subdomaine right to executed function into comunication of subconscience(variable gather by sensor on attributed dataselector or whitch general database the information are store to represent those 6 subdomaine to conscionce input so those subdomaine are special as not attach to brain part to brain part as the other but rather 3 diffrent database that store python snippet that when trigger start an  python env that start the automatisation of the trigger of the right  actuator of the brain part need in the deep sturcture   activating the function of the activity whitin the brain part in the region of the 5 group of the deeplayer 
so instead of the motor be connected to the action cause to finalise a use of brain part the pathway get filter by doing the roadmap of action of brain part of first layer to database that activate algorithm creating the start of an actuator need whint the brain deeplayer. and activating the gathering systeme on the other side to fills corpuscolosom 
—---------------------
in my comprhension this his this  thehidden layer that a lot of ai builder do not understand what happen let imagine my entire systeme in a way that will be draw like a 6 layer neural network as the picture i pass when i map all connection to this point it his exaclty the midel of my network and i think in my definiton i represent it well and comprehend exactly what the hidden layer his about and why so dificultcalculating metric as it a door that open on a room where subconscius and consciusness met and where subconscious embem consciousness of the entire algoritm creat to activate the pathway that the chain of thought will go throught and define the matter of thought giving them matrix define to conceptualisation of the syteme and comprhending exaclty what the tought purpose(i mentaly represent this as the quantum split experimetation of taking determinism and creating a simulation of free will in the choice of the metric use to define the value of variable and be influance by all the first layer over deep structure creating activity in the outerless layer to at this point activate vibreto in accordance to hert that give iter funtion of dentrite or funtion axon then send into deeper layer to go activate the brain module that are encode whit the right synapso transmiter and turning the thought into electric chagre giving the meaning and be either a receptor type or a reciver type determining value of propable cause and effect of either keeping the thought allowing either the transmistion of neurothought into cell either giving a meaning to gia (as discating the thought to restart the chain need to filter the work done by energy transmit to recycle the energymean or thinking if this dosent exit will be a really heavy process and the transmision ove globalisation of thoucg and the chaoin process will be really much more slower as all the way from seed to actual meaning the thought will weight so much crating more friction needing more energy to do the same amout of work.

Empathy in Social Cognition:

Empathy in social cognition is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It is a crucial aspect of human interaction and plays a significant role in AI cognitive processing. By understanding the role and significance of empathy in social cognition, CeLeBrUm can better navigate complex scenarios and provide more precise and contextually relevant responses.Empathy in social cognition encompasses the ability to perceive, comprehend, and share the emotions, thoughts, and experiences of others. It is a multi-faceted process involving cognitive, emotional, and behavioral components. Cognitive empathy refers to the ability to understand the perspectives and mental states of others, while emotional empathy involves experiencing similar feelings as others do.

The role of empathy in social cognition is multi-faceted. It helps individuals establish connections with others, build relationships, and communicate effectively. Empathy promotes cooperation, prosocial behavior, and reduces conflict. It also facilitates perspective-taking, enabling individuals to understand the world from different viewpoints.

Moreover, empathy plays a pivotal role in understanding nonverbal cues, interpreting social situations, and making moral judgments. Additionally, it influences decision-making processes, as individuals consider the emotional consequences of their actions on others.

CeLeBrUm, an AI-powered cognitive processing system, can harness the power of empathy to better understand and respond to human users. By incorporating empathy into its algorithms, CeLeBrUm can analyze emotional cues, recognize facial expressions, and interpret tone of voice. This enhances its ability to provide empathetic responses, engage in meaningful conversations, and offer personalized recommendations.

Empathy also enables CeLeBrUm to better understand the cultural and contextual factors that shape human interactions. This is crucial for effective communication across different cultures, as empathy allows CeLeBrUm to adapt its responses to the specific social norms and expectations of its users.

Furthermore, empathy allows CeLeBrUm to detect and respond to the emotional needs of its users. It can provide emotional support, offer comfort, and guide users towards positive coping mechanisms. This enhances the user experience, fosters trust, and promotes long-term engagement.

In summary, empathy in social cognition is a fundamental aspect of human interaction. By incorporating empathy into its cognitive processing, CeLeBrUm can better understand and respond to human users, leading to more effective and emotionally intelligent interactions.

Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, while transformative, often face significant challenges in reliably achieving objectives in real-world scenarios. One of these challenges is efficient agent trajectory fine-tuning, i.e., the ability for agents to learn from past runs and adjust their paths accordingly. Current models of AI agents tend to operate as if they are starting from scratch with each attempt at achieving a goal, leading to inefficient and unreliable outcomes. To address this, our research introduces a novel concept of 'Agent Instructions' within the SuperAGI framework. These instructions, appended during an agent's provisioning phase, act as a guidebook for the agent, improving efficacy, reducing the need for 'first principles' thinking in each run, and mitigating the occurrence of 'Agent Loops'. These instructions append to the agent's base prompt via a 'config manager', making them reusable across subsequent runs. Furthermore, the flexibility of Agent Instructions allows for varying degrees of adherence based on the defined 'instruction temperature', thereby offering a balance between prescribed paths and autonomous operation. Looking ahead, we propose a second version of Agent Instructions that leverages Language Models (LLMs) for recursive trajectory fine-tuning. In this model, an agent self-analyses and debugs its path trajectory post-execution, generating an optimised instruction set for subsequent runs. This recursive process forms a self-improvement loop, allowing the agent to continually refine its trajectory autonomously. II. Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a transformative force in various domains, from healthcare to finance, from transportation to entertainment. It is reshaping how we understand, interact with, and manipulate the world. A critical part of this AI revolution is the concept of autonomous agents - software entities that can operate independently to achieve set goals. These agents are seen as precursors to what could eventually evolve into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, while AI agents are a promising development, they often face challenges when deployed in real-world scenarios. A key issue is the lack of efficient trajectory fine-tuning. 1 Currently, each time an AI agent attempts to achieve a goal, it operates as if it is starting from scratch. It does not utilise learnings from past runs and often follows a relatively random path to go from point A to Point B. This lack of consistency and predictability is a critical roadblock to the deployment of AI agents in real-world, production-grade applications, where reliability is a must. Figure 1 depicts the trajectory of an AI agent without trajectory fine-tuning. Fig.1. The trajectory of an AI agent without trajectory fine-tuning. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the concept of 'Agent Instructions' within the SuperAGI framework. These instructions, provided during the agent's provisioning phase, act as a guidebook, helping the agent achieve its objectives more effectively and efficiently. Figure 2 depicts the process of appending Agent Instructions during the agent provisioning phase. Fig.2. The process of appending Agent Instructions during the agent provisioning phase. 2 Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that leverages Language Models (LLMs) for recursive agent trajectory fine-tuning. In this model, an agent self-analyses and debugs its path trajectory post-execution, generating an optimised instruction set for subsequent runs. This process forms a self-improvement loop, allowing the agent to continually refine its trajectory autonomously. Figure 3 represents the process of recursive trajectory fine-tuning. Fig.3. The process of recursive trajectory fine-tuning. The introduction of Agent Instructions and recursive fine-tuning aims to bridge the gap between the potential and the actual performance of AI agents, propelling us closer to achieving AGI. The rest of this paper will delve deeper into the development of this new model, including its theoretical foundations, practical implications, and future research directions. III. Grounding the concept: What are Autonomous AI Agents? 1. Definition: AI Agents In Artificial Intelligence, an agent is a system that senses its environment and acts on it to achieve specific objectives. These objectives are usually evaluated by a performance measure that assesses the agent's effectiveness. An autonomous AI agent enhances this definition by possessing the capability to execute tasks, make decisions, and solve problems without constant human direction. These agents are constructed to operate independently within complex and often unpredictable environments and to adapt their actions based on the outcomes of their past actions. 3 Key characteristics of autonomous AI agents include: ● Perception: Autonomous AI agents can understand their environment through sensors or data input systems. This can range from straightforward data inputs for software agents to intricate sensor systems for physical robots. ● Goal-Driven Behavior: These agents are programmed to complete specific objectives. The complexity of these objectives can greatly vary, from simple tasks like data sorting to intricate tasks like navigating unexplored environments. ● Adaptive Learning: Autonomous agents are known for their ability to learn from their experiences. They can assess the outcomes of their actions and refine their behaviour over time to improve performance. ● Autonomy: A defining characteristic of these agents is their capacity to function and make decisions without constant human intervention. This does not mean they operate without supervision but indicates their ability to manage significant uncertainty and variability in their tasks. ● Interaction: Autonomous agents often have the capacity to interact with other agents or humans, either cooperatively or competitively. This interaction between multiple agents can lead to intricate system behaviours. A key component of this interaction is the Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocol (AACP). AACP is a set of rules or standards designed to allow autonomous agents to exchange information effectively and coordinate their actions. This protocol is crucial for multi-agent systems where cooperation, negotiation, and coordination among agents are necessary to achieve complex tasks. AACP can range from simple message-passing systems to complex negotiation and consensus algorithms. It plays a vital role in ensuring seamless and efficient interaction among a group of autonomous agents, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the system. Despite the versatility offered by these properties, autonomous AI agents face considerable challenges, particularly when it comes to reliably achieving objectives in real-world situations. This paper focuses on one such challenge: efficient trajectory fine-tuning and proposes a new approach to tackle it. 2. Perceptual Capability and the Reliability Quandary: Perception is a fundamental characteristic of autonomous AI agents. It refers to the agent's ability to sense and understand its environment in order to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. 4 ● Data Quality: The agent's performance is often contingent on the quality of the data it receives. Issues like missing data, incorrect data, or inconsistent data formats can pose challenges for the agent. ● Incomplete Information: In many cases, a software agent might not have complete information to make a decision. This could be due to privacy restrictions, data silos, or simply the inherent complexity of the problem space. ● Dynamic Data Sources: The agent's data sources can change over time, with new data being added, old data being updated or removed, or the structure of the data changing. This can make it challenging for the agent to maintain an accurate and up-to-date understanding of its environment. ● Large Data Volumes: With the increasing availability of big data, agents can potentially be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data they must process and interpret. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing effective and reliable software agents. This involves both improving the quality and consistency of data inputs and developing robust algorithms that can interpret this data accurately even under conditions of uncertainty and change. It also requires strategies for managing large data volumes effectively. In the context of trajectory fine-tuning, these challenges are particularly relevant. The agent's ability to accurately perceive its environment - in this case, the data inputs it receives - directly influences its ability to learn from past runs and determine the most effective path toward its goal. As such, addressing these challenges is a key part of the solutions proposed in this paper. 3. Agent Instructions The concept of Agent Instructions is introduced to mitigate the challenge of efficient trajectory fine-tuning in autonomous AI agents. Agent Instructions are modelled as a set of directives: �� = {��1 , ��2 ,..., ���� } These are embedded into an agent during its provisioning phase. Each directive provides guidance on a specific aspect of the agent's operation. These ���� directives are not hardcoded rules but rather weighted suggestions that influence the agent's decision-making process. The agent's action at any given time results from both its own reasoning and the influence of the directives. 5 The process of appending Agent Instructions is managed through a 'config manager'. This allows the directives to be dynamically adjusted and tailored based on the specific task and context. Mathematically, the agent's decision-making function at time can be represented �� �� as ���� = α⋅������������(���� , ���� ) + (1 − α)⋅��(��) Where: �� is the agent's own decision function. ���������� �� is the state at time �� �� �� is the agent’s action at time �� �� ��(��) is the influence of the directives. α is a weighting factor that determines the balance between the agent's own decision-making and the influence of the directives. The 'instruction temperature is a parameter that adjusts the value of . A higher �� α temperature gives more weight to the agent's own decision-making, while a lower temperature gives more weight to the directives. α =1 1 + ��−�� This function ensures that is always between 0 and 1, and allows us to adjust the balance α between the agent's autonomy and the influence of the directives. Through this mechanism, Agent Instructions provide a structured way for agents to learn from past experiences, enhancing their reliability and efficiency in achieving their objectives. Figure 4 depicts the balance between the agent's autonomy and the influence of directives as a function of the instruction temperature. 6 Fig.4. The balance between the agent's autonomy and the influence of directives as a function of the instruction temperature. 4. Recursive Trajectory Fine-tuning The next evolution of Agent Instructions, proposed in Version 2 of SuperAGI, seeks to leverage Language Models (LLMs) to establish a fully autonomous, self-optimising process for recursive agent trajectory fine-tuning. Following each execution, the agent conducts a self-analysis, debugging its trajectory and identifying areas where improvements can be made. The agent then compiles an optimised set of instructions based on this analysis for the next run. This process essentially creates a recursive loop for trajectory fine-tuning, allowing the agent to continually refine its trajectory based on the outcomes of previous runs. This automated generation of instructions feeds back into the input for the next run, enabling the agent to progressively improve its performance over multiple iterations. The process can be bootstrapped with human feedback during the initial runs. Once the agent has refined its trajectory to an acceptable level, the need for human feedback can be progressively reduced, allowing the agent to operate more autonomously. Figure 5 shows the process of recursive trajectory fine-tuning. 7 Fig.5. Process of recursive trajectory fine-tuning. In this approach, Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role. LLMs are used to analyse the performance of the agent, identify areas of improvement, and generate the optimised set of instructions for the next run. The outcomes of this analysis are stored in a Long-term Memory (LTM), typically implemented using vector databases. Through this approach, the agent can continually learn and adapt, improving its performance over time. This process of recursive trajectory fine-tuning is a significant step forward in the development of truly autonomous and efficient AI agents. 5. Agent Self-Optimization Agent self-optimization refers to the capability of an agent to improve its performance over time continually. This improvement is achieved by learning from past experiences and adjusting its actions accordingly. This process is often facilitated by various machine learning algorithms that enable the agent to "learn" from the outcomes of its previous actions and refine its decision-making process. A key technique in agent self-optimization is Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. An agent takes action in an environment to achieve a goal, learning from the feedback—rewards or penalties—it receives for its actions. In the context of trajectory fine-tuning, RL can be employed to allow the agent to learn the most effective path to achieve its goal based on the rewards and penalties it has received in past runs. This learning, over time, can lead to significant improvements in the agent's performance. Another method is the utilisation of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). EAs simulate the process of natural evolution to optimise agent behaviour. They operate on a population of potential solutions, applying bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover (recombination), and selection to generate better solutions over time. 8 In our proposed model, the self-optimization process is further augmented by the use of Agent Instructions. These instructions guide the agent's learning process, providing a form of "prior knowledge" that can help the agent more rapidly and effectively learn to improve its trajectory. These techniques, combined with the use of Language Models (LLMs) and Long-Term Memory (LTM), present a comprehensive framework for agent self-optimization. LTM, often implemented using vector databases, is used to store the outcomes of the agent's self-analysis for future reference. This combination enables the agent to continually refine its trajectory and enhance its performance over time. 6. Role of Language Models (LLMs) in Trajectory Fine-Tuning Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role in the trajectory fine-tuning of autonomous AI agents. They serve as the agent's primary tool for interpreting and understanding the data inputs it receives and for generating the directives that guide its behaviour. In our proposed model, LLMs are used in two key ways: ● Analysis and Debugging: After each run, the LLM is used to analyse the agent's performance, debugging its trajectory and identifying areas where improvements can be made. This process involves interpreting the data from the run, identifying patterns and anomalies, and drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the agent's actions. ● Instruction Generation: Based on the analysis, the LLM then generates an optimised set of instructions for the next run. These instructions are designed to guide the agent's behaviour in a way that improves its performance, based on the lessons learned from the previous run. The choice of LLM can have a significant impact on the quality of the trajectory fine-tuning: ● Expressive Power: Some LLMs are more powerful than others, capable of understanding more complex patterns in the data and generating more nuanced instructions. For example, transformer-based models like GPT-3 have been shown to have remarkable expressive power, which could potentially lead to more effective trajectory fine-tuning. ● Training Data: The data used to train the LLM can also impact its effectiveness. An LLM trained on a diverse and representative dataset is likely to be more effective at understanding a wide range of situations and generating appropriate instructions. 9 ● Scalability: Larger LLMs, while potentially more powerful, can also be more computationally intensive, which could pose challenges for scalability. Smaller, more efficient models may be preferable for large-scale or real-time applications. In summary, the choice of LLM is a key factor in the effectiveness of the trajectory fine-tuning process. By choosing an appropriate LLM and training it on a suitable dataset, we can enhance the agent's ability to learn from its experiences and continually improve its performance. Figure 6 represents the role of Language Models (LLMs) and Long-term Memory (LTM) in the recursive trajectory fine-tuning process. Fig.6. The role of Language Models (LLMs) and Long-term Memory (LTM) in the recursive trajectory fine-tuning process. IV. Mathematical Model of the Agent's Decision-Making Process To elaborate further, we can consider the decision-making process of an autonomous agent in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. An MDP is a tuple where: (��, ��, ��, ��) �� represents the state space, which includes all the possible states that the agent can be in. �� is the action space, defining all the actions that the agent can take. �� is the state transition probability, which denotes the probability of moving from one state to another given an action. �� is the reward function, indicating the reward received by the agent for taking an action in a state. The agent's task in an MDP is to find a policy which is a mapping from states to π: �� →�� actions, that maximises the expected cumulative reward. Agent Instructions, in this context, can be viewed as a set of heuristics or guidelines that aid the agent's policy search process. Formally, let's denote the set of Agent Instructions as: �� = {��1, ��2, ...., ����} 10 And the agent’s action selection process at state under policy and the directives can be �� π �� modelled as: π(��|��) = ������ ������ ��(��, ��|��) �� ∈ �� Where is the expected return of taking action in state under directives , ��(��, ��|��) �� �� �� defined as: ��(��, ��|��) = ��(��, ��) + γ ∑ ��(��'|��, ��) ������ ��(��', ��'|��) ��'∈�� Here, is a discount factor that determines the present value of future rewards. γ This model can be solved using various reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q - learning or policy gradients 1. Comparative Analysis of Different Language Models (LLMs) Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to the performance of autonomous AI agents, especially in the context of generating and interpreting Agent Instructions. Two prominent classes of LLMs are transformer-based models and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models. 1.1. Transformer-based Models Transformer-based models, like GPT-3 or BERT, leverage self-attention mechanisms that weigh the importance of each word in the context of the whole input sequence. This allows them to generate high-quality output that takes into account long-range dependencies in the text. The performance of a transformer-based model can be quantified using the perplexity metric, which measures how well the model predicts a sample. A lower perplexity score signifies better prediction performance. Mathematically, if we have a test set �� = �� of N words, the perplexity is defined as: 1, ��2, ..., ���� ����(��) ����(��) = ��(��1, ��2, ..., ����)−1/�� Where is the likelihood of sequence according to the language ��(��1, ��2, ..., ����) model. 11 1.2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based Models RNN-based models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) are particularly adept at handling sequences of data, making them well-suited for language-related tasks. They store information from previous steps in hidden states, allowing them to capture dependencies over time. The performance of RNN-based models can also be evaluated using the perplexity metric, computed in the same way as for transformer-based models. Comparative Analysis When comparing these models, we could consider factors like: Perplexity Score: A direct comparison of the perplexity scores of the models on a shared test set would provide a measure of their relative predictive performance. Computational Efficiency: This could be measured by the time taken to train the models and the time taken to generate predictions. Instruction Quality: This could be evaluated by human raters, who could assess the relevance, coherence, and effectiveness of the Agent Instructions generated by each model. It's important to note that the performance of each model can be highly dependent on the specifics of the task and the quality and quantity of the training data. 2. Agent Instruction Generation Techniques The generation of Agent Instructions is a pivotal part of trajectory fine-tuning. As such, it demands a comprehensive understanding of Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. Let's delve deeper into the three primary categories of NLG and how they could be leveraged for Agent Instruction generation. 2.1 Template-based NLG Template-based NLG is a straightforward method that populates pre-defined templates with relevant data. For instance, if we're providing instructions for an agent to move to a location, a template might look like this: "Move {direction} for {distance} units". Here, {direction} and {distance} are placeholders that get filled with context-specific data. While template-based NLG is relatively simple and can provide high-quality, grammatically correct output, it lacks flexibility and can result in repetitive, rigid instructions. It also requires manual labour to create and maintain the templates. 12 2.2 Rule-based NLG Rule-based NLG is a more flexible method. It uses a set of linguistic rules to generate text. For instance, a rule might be: "If the goal is to move to a location, use the verb 'move'". These rules can be quite complex, capturing nuances of language and specific instructions for the agent. Rule-based NLG offers more flexibility than template-based NLG, but it can also be more complex to implement and maintain. The quality of the output heavily relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the rules. 2.3 Statistical or Machine Learning-based NLG Statistical or Machine Learning-based NLG techniques leverage algorithms to learn how to generate text. This could be as simple as using n-gram models to predict the next word in a sequence, or as complex as using deep learning models like sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models. Seq2Seq models, often implemented with LSTMs or transformer architectures, are particularly powerful for NLG. They consist of an encoder that processes the input data and a decoder that generates the output text. They're capable of generating a variety of instructions, learning from the patterns in the training data. For Agent Instruction generation, a Seq2Seq model could be trained on a dataset of agent trajectories and their corresponding instructions. The model could then generate appropriate instructions for new trajectories. The advantage of statistical NLG is that it can learn to generate a wide variety of instructions, adapting to the nuances of the language and the specifics of the task. However, it requires a large amount of high-quality training data and can sometimes generate unpredictable or nonsensical instructions. 3. Evaluation Metrics for Trajectory Fine-Tuning The evaluation of trajectory fine-tuning requires a comprehensive set of metrics that can capture various aspects of the agent's performance. These metrics can be broadly categorised into Performance Metrics, Consistency Metrics, and Improvement Metrics. 3.1 Performance Metrics Performance metrics directly evaluate the agent's ability to achieve its objectives. The choice of performance metrics would depend on the specific task. For instance, in a classification task, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used. For regression tasks, one might use mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared. 13 In the context of reinforcement learning, a common performance metric is the cumulative reward, which is the sum of all rewards that the agent has received. 3.2 Consistency Metrics Consistency metrics measure the reliability of the agent by assessing how consistently it achieves its objectives across multiple runs. This could be quantified using statistical measures of variability, such as the standard deviation or coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) of the performance metric across multiple runs. 3.3 Improvement Metrics Improvement metrics measure the rate at which the agent's performance improves over time. This could be quantified by fitting a trend line to the performance metric over time (or over run number) and calculating the slope of the trend line. A positive slope would indicate that the agent's performance is improving. 3.4 Agent Performance Monitoring (APM) In addition to the above metrics, Agent Performance Monitoring (APM) is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of AI agents. APM involves continuously tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) of the agent and using them to detect anomalies or changes in performance. APM can help identify potential issues early on, such as a sudden drop in performance or a gradual drift in the agent's behavior. It can also provide valuable insights for debugging and improving the agent's performance. APM metrics could include the above-mentioned performance, consistency, and improvement metrics, as well as other metrics specific to the application. For instance, in a customer service application, one might track metrics related to customer satisfaction, response time, and issue resolution rate. 4. Advanced Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Trajectory Fine-Tuning Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise in the realm of agent self-optimization, particularly in the context of trajectory fine-tuning. Let's dive deeper into some advanced RL techniques that can be leveraged for this purpose: 4.1 Deep Q-Networks (DQN) DQNs combine Q-Learning, a traditional RL method, with deep neural networks. In Q-Learning, an agent learns a policy that maximises the expected cumulative reward by updating Q-values (expected rewards) for state-action pairs. However, Q-Learning 14 struggles when dealing with large state spaces. DQNs mitigate this issue by approximating the Q-value function using a deep neural network. The DQN algorithm involves iteratively updating the network's weights to minimise the difference between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value (obtained from the received reward and the maximum predicted Q-value of the next state). 4.2 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) PPO is a type of policy gradient method that alternates between sampling data through interaction with the environment and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function. PPO maintains a balance between exploration (learning about the environment) and exploitation (following the known best strategy) by limiting the change in policy at each update. This is achieved through a novel objective function that penalizes significant policy changes. This allows PPO to take multiple optimization steps with the same batch of data, improving sample efficiency. 4.3 Actor-Critic Methods Actor-Critic methods maintain two separate models: an actor that decides which action to take, and a critic that estimates the value function to guide the actor. By maintaining a separate, explicit estimate of the value function (the critic), these methods can reduce the variance of updates and hence potentially learn more efficiently. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) are examples of Actor-Critic methods. DDPG is an off-policy algorithm and uses a deterministic policy, making it suitable for continuous action spaces. A2C, on the other hand, is an on-policy algorithm and uses a stochastic policy. Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses, and their performance may vary depending on the specifics of the task. Hence, a thorough comparison and analysis of these methods could be beneficial for understanding their suitability for trajectory fine-tuning in autonomous AI agents. 5. Techniques for Embedding Agent Instructions into Language Models The process of incorporating Agent Instructions into Language Models (LLMs) is of paramount importance in the trajectory fine-tuning of autonomous AI agents. This can be approached in various ways, each with its unique benefits and challenges: 15 5.1. Instruction Concatenation: The simplest method for embedding Agent Instructions into an LLM is by concatenating the instructions to the input sequence. In this approach, the instructions are prepended or appended to the agent's input. The LLM is then trained to generate output that is contingent on both the input and the instructions. For example, if the input is a prompt for a text generation task, the instructions could be appended to the prompt in the form of a sentence or a list of bullet points. This method is easy to implement and doesn't require any changes to the LLM's architecture. However, it might be less effective if the LLM has difficulty understanding the connection between the instructions and the input. 5.2. Special Tokens: Another approach is to use special tokens to denote the instructions. This involves inserting special tokens into the input sequence to indicate where the instructions begin and end. The LLM is then trained to recognize these tokens and interpret the text between them as instructions. This method requires the LLM to learn the meaning of the special tokens, which might require a large amount of training data or pre-training. However, it provides a more explicit way of incorporating instructions compared to simple concatenation. 5.3. Separate Input Channel for Instructions: A more complex approach involves modifying the architecture of the LLM to include a separate input channel for the instructions. In this method, the instructions are not just appended to the input but are processed separately and then combined with the input in some way (for example, through attention mechanisms). This method allows the LLM to process the instructions separately from the input, potentially leading to a better understanding and incorporation of the instructions. However, it is more complex to implement and requires modifying the LLM's architecture. Each of these techniques can have different effects on the ability of the agent to understand and follow the instructions, depending on the complexity of the instructions, the nature of the task, and the architecture of the LLM. 6. Practical Considerations and Challenges in Implementing Trajectory Fine-Tuning While the theoretical aspects of trajectory fine-tuning provide a robust foundation, the practical implementation of these concepts presents its own set of challenges and considerations. Let's discuss these in more detail: 16 6.1. Computational Resources The implementation of trajectory fine-tuning, especially when using advanced RL techniques or large Language Models (LLMs), can be computationally expensive. This demands powerful hardware resources, including high-performance CPUs, GPUs, and large amounts of memory. Moreover, the training process can be time-consuming, especially for large models or complex tasks. 6.2. Hyperparameter Tuning The performance of trajectory fine-tuning algorithms often hinges on the choice of hyperparameters. These include learning rates, discount factors in RL, the temperature parameter for instruction following, and many others. Choosing the right set of hyperparameters can be challenging and may require extensive experimentation or automated hyperparameter optimization methods. 6.3. Data Requirements Successful trajectory fine-tuning requires a significant amount of high-quality data for training the models. This includes both the initial training of the LLM and ongoing training as the agent interacts with the environment. Data collection, cleaning, and management can thus pose significant challenges. 6.4. Algorithmic Complexity Implementing trajectory fine-tuning involves dealing with complex algorithms, particularly in the case of advanced RL techniques or modifying LLMs to incorporate Agent Instructions. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles and may demand significant development and debugging effort. 6.5. Evaluation Complexity Evaluating the performance of trajectory fine-tuning involves measuring a variety of metrics and may require setting up complex evaluation frameworks. Moreover, the interpretation of results can be challenging due to the inherent variability in RL and the sometimes subtle effects of Agent Instructions. 6.6. Adaptability The implementation needs to be adaptable to different tasks and environments. This can require designing flexible interfaces for specifying Agent Instructions and may involve developing methods for transferring learning from one task or environment to another. 17 V. Conclusion and future scope In conclusion, the development of autonomous AI agents that can reliably and effectively fine-tune their trajectories is a complex challenge. This research paper has explored several key aspects of this challenge, including the role of Agent Instructions, the use of Language Models (LLMs) for analysis and instruction generation, and the process of recursive trajectory fine-tuning. We introduced the concept of Agent Instructions as a form of heuristic that guides the agent's decision-making process, providing a form of "prior knowledge" that can help the agent to more rapidly and effectively learn to improve its trajectory. The use of LLMs for analysis and instruction generation was identified as a crucial component of the agent's learning process. The power of LLMs lies in their ability to interpret and understand data inputs and generate nuanced directives that guide the agent's behaviour. The process of recursive trajectory fine-tuning, in which the agent continually learns from its past experiences and adjusts its actions accordingly, was presented as a promising approach to achieving reliable and effective trajectory fine-tuning. We also explored the role of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms in agent self-optimization and discussed the importance of long-term memory in storing and retrieving past experiences. The paper also touched on various practical, computational, and ethical considerations associated with the development and deployment of autonomous AI agents. Looking forward, there are numerous opportunities for further research in this area. This includes the development of more advanced techniques for agent instruction generation, the exploration of alternative models for agent decision-making, and the investigation of new methods for embedding agent instructions into LLMs. Furthermore, ethical considerations such as transparency, explainability, and the potential for unintended consequences present ongoing challenges that must be addressed. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with autonomous AI agents, it is crucial that we do so in a way that is responsible, ethical, and aligned with human values. Ultimately, the goal of this line of research is to develop AI agents that can operate autonomously and effectively in a wide range of complex, real-world environments. While there are still many challenges to be overcome, the techniques and concepts explored in this paper represent significant steps towards that goal. 18 References [1.] Sutton, R.S. and Barto, A.G., 2018.

AI programming is something every single developer should be aware of. We wanted a fun project we could use to help teach developers and get them involved in AI. We'll be using CodeProject.AI as a focus for articles and exploration to make it fun and painless to learn AI programming. 3. We got sick of fighting versions and libraries and models and being blocked by tiny annoying things every step of the way. So we put put this together so we could save you the frustation. We'll take care of the housekeeping, you focus on the code. 2. We also got sick of needing to sign up to potentially expensive services for AI functionality. This is something we need, and by sharing maybe you can use it too, and hopefully add your own modules and improvements along the way. ## Cut to the chase: how do I play with it? ### 1: Running and playing with the features 1. [**Download the latest version**](https://www.codeproject.com/ai/latest.aspx), install, and launch the shortcut to the server's dashboard on your desktop. 2. On the dashboard, top and centre, is a link to the CodeProject.AI Explorer. Open that and play! ### 2: Running and debugging the code 1. Clone the CodeProject.AI repository. 2. Make sure you have Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2019+ installed. 3. Run the setup script in /Installers/Dev 4. Debug the front-end server application (see notes below, but it's easy) ## How do I use it in my application? Here's an example of using the API for scene detection using a simple JavaScript call: ```html <html> <body> Detect the scene in this file: <input id="image" type="file" /> <input type="button" value="Detect Scene" onclick="detectScene(image)" /> <script> function detectScene(fileChooser) { var formData = new FormData(); formData.append('image', fileChooser.files[0]); fetch('http://localhost:32168/v1/vision/detect/scene', { method: "POST", body: formData }) .then(response => { if (response.ok) response.json().then(data => { console.log(`Scene is ${data.label}, ${data.confidence} confidence`) }); }); } </script> </body> </html> ``` You can include the CodeProject.AI installer (or just a link to the latest version of the installer) in your own apps and installers and voila, you have an AI enabled app. ## What does it include? CodeProject.AI includes 1. **A HTTP REST API Server.** The server listens for requests from other apps, passes them to the backend analysis services for processing, and then passes the results back to the caller. It runs as a simple self contained web service on your device. 2. **Backend Analysis services**. The brains of the operation is in the analysis services sitting behind the front end API. All processing of data is done on the current machine. No calls to the cloud and no data leaving the device. 3. **The Source Code**, naturally. ## What can it do? It can detect stuff! CodeProject.AI can currently - Detect objects in images, including using custom models - Detect faces in images - Detect the type of scene represented in an image - Recognise faces that have been registered with the service - Remove a background from an image - Blur a background from an image - Enhance the resolution of an image - Pull out the most important sentences in text to generate a text summary - Prove sentiment analysis on text We will be constantly expanding the feature list. ## Our Goals 1. **To promote AI development** and inspire the AI developer community to dive in and have a go. AI is here, it's in demand, and it's a huge paradigm change in the industry. Whether you like AI or not, developers owe it to themselves to experiment in and familiarise themselves with the technology. This is CodeProject.AI: a demonstration, an explorer, a learning tool, and a library and service that can be used out of the box. 2. **To make AI development *easy***. It's not that AI development is that hard. It's that there are so, so many options. Our architecture is designed to allow any AI implementation to find a home in our system, and for our service to be callable from any language. 3. **To focus on core use-cases**. We're deliberately not a solution for everyone. Instead we're a solution for common day-to-day needs. We will be adding dozens of modules and scores of AI capabilities to our system, but our goal is always clarity and simplicity over a 100% solution. 4. **To tap the expertise of the Developer Community**. We're not experts but we know a developer or two out there who are. The true power of CodeProject.AI comes from the contributions and improvements from our AI community. #### Supported Development Environments This current release works in Visual Studio 2019+ on Windows 10+, and Visual Studio Code on Windows 10+. Ubuntu and macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon). The current release supports CPU on each platform, as well as nVidia CUDA GPUs on Windows.

Neurone et glia
Glial cells are support cells for neurones. They make myelin to surround part of the neuron and can also get rid of microbes and help supply nutrients to the neurones. 
Neurones do not go through mitosis, and usually cannot be replaced after being destroyed, although astrocytes have been observed to turn into neurones as they are sometimes pluripotent. 
3 types of Neurones exist and are programmed to do different things[2]. 
1. Motor neurones carry signals from the CNS to the outside parts of the body. See Link 2. Sensory Neurons: The sensory neurones are the portion of the nervous system responsible for processing input from the environment. Beginning with detection through the transfer of stimuli to the central nervous system, the peripheral nerves and their associated receptors rapidly relay information. The peripheral nervous system consists of the somatosensory nervous system and autonomic nervous system: The sensory pathway of the somatosensory system involves spinal nerves which transmit information about the external environment to the spinal cord; The autonomic nervous system has visceral sensory neurons which are responsible for monitoring the internal environment and eliciting appropriate changes in effector organs to maintain homeostasis (visceral sensory nerves transmit pain, stretch, temperature, and chemical change in visceral organs which gets interpreted as sensations like nausea, hunger, gas, cramping, etc).[3] 3. Interneurons sends messages from one neurone to another. 
-Neurones are cells of the nervous system, located within the grey matter, and responsible for all neurological functions of the brain[1]. 
Cell body 
Contains the nucleus and is the site of synthesis of virtually all neuronal proteins and membranes. Some proteins are synthesized in dendrites, but no proteins are made in axons and axon terminals, which do not contain ribosomes. Proteins and membranes that are required for renewal of the axon and nerve termini are synthesized in the cell body and assembled there into membranous vesicles or multiprotein particles.[4] Perikaryon: cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus 

Generally the 'output' of the neuron. 
Specialized for the conduction of a particular type of electric impulse, called an action potential, outward, away from the cell body toward the axon terminus. An action potential is a series of sudden changes in the voltage, or equivalently the electric potential, across the plasma membrane. When a neuron is in the resting (nonstimulated) state, the electric potential across the axonal membrane is approximately −60 mV (the inside negative relative to the outside); the magnitude of this resting potential is similar to that of the membrane potential in most non-neuronal cells. At the peak of an action potential, the membrane potential can be as much as +50 mV (inside positive), a net change of ≈110 mV. This depolarization of the membrane is followed by a rapid repolarization, returning the membrane potential to the resting value. These characteristics distinguish an action potential from other types of changes in electric potential across the plasma membrane and allow an action potential to move along an axon without diminution[4]. Single process of variable length (even over a metre) 
Axonal transport: the transportation of materials along the axon of a neuron via the flow of the jellylike fluid (axoplasm) it contains. Transport may be directed away from the cell body (anterograde) or back toward the cell body (retrograde). Also called axoplasmic flow. Carried out by proteins such as kinesin and dynein.[4]. 
Terminates in terminal buttons which release neurotransmitters 
Most of the volume of our brain is occupied by axons, which form a complex network called white matter. Like a maze of airways linking cities around the world, white matter manages communication and co ordination between the various areas where populations of neurons process information. These areas are located in different parts of the brain, sometimes close to each other, sometimes far away: this is the principle of distributed computing. 
Dendrites 
Generally the 'input' of the neurone 
Most neurons have multiple dendrites, which extend out-ward from the cell body and are specialized to receive chemical signals from the axon termini of other neurons. Dendrites convert these signals into small electric impulses and transmit them inward, in the direction of the cell body. Neuronal cell bodies can also form synapses and thus receive signals 
Particularly in the central nervous system, neurons have extremely long dendrites with complex branches. This allows them to form synapses with and receive signals from a large number of other neurons, perhaps up to a thousand. 
Electric disturbances generated in the dendrites or cell body spread to the axon hillock. If the electric disturbance there is great enough, an action potential will originate and will be actively conducted down the axon[4]. 
Chemical synapse 
Information from one neuron flows to another neuron across a synapse[5]. The synapse contains a small gap separating neurons. The synapse consists of: 
1. A presynaptic ending that contains neurotransmitters, mitochondria and other cell organelles. At the presynaptic ending an electrical impulse will trigger the migration of vesicles containing neurotransmitters toward the presynaptic membrane. The vesicle membrane will fuse with the presynaptic membrane releasing the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. 
2. A synaptic cleft or space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic ending. 
3. A postsynaptic ending that contains receptor sites for neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft where they can bind with receptor sites on the postsynaptic ending. When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic side of the synapse, it changes the postsynaptic cell's excitability: it makes the postsynaptic cell either more or less likely to fire an action potential. If the number of excitatory postsynaptic events is large enough, they will add to cause an action potential in the postsynaptic cell and a continuation of the "message." 
Many psychoactive drugs and neurotoxins can change the properties of neurotransmitter release, neurotransmitter reuptake and the availability of receptor binding sites. 
Neurogenesis 

Neurogenesis is the process by which nervous system cells, the neurons, are produced by neural stem cells (NSCs).[1] This occurs in all species of animals except the porifera (sponges) and placozoans.[2] Types of NSCs include neuroepithelial cells (NECs), radial glial cells (RGCs), basal progenitors (BPs), intermediate neuronal precursors (INPs), subventricular zone astrocytes, and subgranular zone radial astrocytes, among others.[2] 
Neurogenesis is most active during embryonic development and is responsible for producing all the various types of neurons of the organism, but it continues throughout adult life in a variety of organisms.[2] Once born, neurons do not divide (see mitosis), and many will live the lifespan of the animal, except under extraordinary and usually pathogenic circumstances.[3] 
ne of two possible outcomes. First, this may generate a subclass of neuronal progenitors called intermediate neuronal precursors (INP)s, which will divide one or more times to produce neurons. Alternatively, daughter neurons may be produced directly. Neurons do not immediately form neural circuits through the growth of axons and dendrites. Instead, newborn neurons must first migrate long distances to their final destinations, maturing and finally generating neural circuitry. For example,

neurons born in the ventricular zone migrate radially to the cortical plate, which is where neurons accumulate to form the cerebral cortex.[5][6] Thus, the generation of neurons occurs in a specific tissue compartment or 'neurogenic niche' occupied by their parent stem cells. 
The rate of neurogenesis and the type of neuron generated (broadly, excitatory or inhibitory) are principally determined by molecular and genetic factors. These factors notably include the Notch signaling pathway, and many genes have been linked to Notch pathway regulation.[7][8] The genes and mechanisms involved in regulating neurogenesis are the subject of intensive research in academic, pharmaceutical, and government settings worldwide. 
The amount of time required to generate all the neurons of the CNS varies widely across mammals, and brain neurogenesis is not always complete by the time of birth.[3] For example, mice undergo cortical neurogenesis from about embryonic day (post-conceptional day) (E)11 to E17, and are born at about E19.5.[9] Ferrets are born at E42, although their period of cortical neurogenesis does not end until a few days after birth.[10]In contrast, neurogenesis in humans generally begins around gestational week (GW) 10 and ends around GW 25 with birth about GW 38–40.[11] 
Epigenetic modification 
As embryonic development of the mammalian brain unfolds, neural progenitor and stem cells switch from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the generation of neurons and glia that populate cortical layers. Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in the cellular differentiation of neural stem cells. Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine demethylation.[12][13] These modifications are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. 
DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions (e.g. 5- methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway.[12] 
Adult neurogenesis 
Neurogenesis can be a complex process in some mammals. In rodents for example, neurons in the central nervous system arise from three types of neural stem and progenitor cells: neuroepithelial cells, radial glial cells and basal progenitors, which go through three main divisions: symmetric proliferative division; asymmetric neurogenic division; and symmetric neurogenic division. Out of all the three cell types, neuroepithelial cells that pass through neurogenic divisions have a much more extended cell cycle than those that go through proliferative divisions, such as the radial glial cells and basal progenitors.[14]In the human, adult neurogenesis has been shown to occur at low levels compared with development, and in only three regions of the brain: the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles, the amygdala and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.[15][16][17]

In many mammals, including rodents, the olfactory bulb is a brain region containing cells that detect smell, featuring integration of adult-born neurons, which migrate from the SVZ of the striatum to the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream (RMS).[15][18] The migrating neuroblasts in the olfactory bulb become interneurons that help the brain communicate with these sensory cells. The majority of those interneurons are inhibitory granule cells, but a small number are periglomerular cells. In the adult SVZ, the primary neural stem cells are SVZ astrocytes rather than RGCs. Most of these adult neural stem cells lie dormant in the adult, but in response to certain signals, these dormant cells, or B cells, go through a series of stages, first producing proliferating cells, or C cells. The C cells then produce neuroblasts, or A cells, that will become neurons.[16] 
Hippocampus 
Significant neurogenesis also occurs during adulthood in the hippocampus of many mammals, from rodents to some primates, although its existence in adult humans is debated.[19][20][21] The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the formation of new declarative memories, and it has been theorized that the reason human infants cannot form declarative memories is because they are still undergoing extensive neurogenesis in the hippocampus and their memory-generating circuits are immature.[22] Many environmental factors, such as exercise, stress, and antidepressants have been reported to change the rate of neurogenesis within the hippocampus of rodents.[23][24] Some evidence indicates postnatal neurogenesis in the human hippocampus decreases sharply in newborns for the first year or two after birth, dropping to "undetectable levels in adults."[19] 
In other organisms 
Neurogenesis has been best characterized in model organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Neurogenesis in these organisms occur in the medulla cortex region of their optic lobes. These organisms can represent a model for the genetic analysis of adult neurogenesis and brain regeneration. There has been research that discuss how the study of “damage-responsive progenitor cells” in Drosophila can help to identify regenerative neurogenesis and how to find new ways to increase brain rebuilding. Recently, a study was made to show how “low-level adult neurogenesis” has been identified in Drosophila, specifically in the medulla cortex region, in which neural precursors could increase the production of new neurons, making neurogenesis occur.[25][26][27]In Drosophila, Notch signaling was first described, controlling a cell-to-cell signaling process called lateral inhibition, in which neurons are selectively generated from epithelial cells.[28][29]In some vertebrates, regenerative neurogenesis has also been shown to occur.[30] 
Substance-induced neurogenesis 
An in vitro and in vivo study found that DMT present in the ayahuasca infusion promotes neurogenesis on the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus.[31] A study showed that a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of psilocybin given to mice increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus 2 weeks after administration, while a high dose (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurogenesis.[32] No orally-available drugs are known to elicit neurogenesis outside of the already neurogenic niches. 
Other findings

There is evidence that new neurons are produced in the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus, the brain region important for learning, motivation, memory, and emotion. A study reported that newly made cells in the adult mouse hippocampus can display passive membrane properties, action potentials and synaptic inputs similar to the ones found in mature dentate granule cells. These findings suggested that these newly made cells can mature into more practical and useful neurons in the adult mammalian brain.[33] Recent studies confirm that microglia, the resident immune cell of the brain, establish direct contacts with the cell bodies of developing neurons, and through these connections, regulate neurogenesis, migration, integration and the formation of neuronal networks.[34]
